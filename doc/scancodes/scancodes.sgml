This note contains some information about PC keyboard scancodes.
</abstract>

<toc>

<sect>Ordinary PC keyboards<p>
The data from a keyboard comes mainly in the form of scancodes,
produced by key presses or used in the protocol with the computer.
(Different codes are used by the keyboard firmware internally,
and there also exist several
<ref id="scancode_modes" name="sets of scancodes">. Here, for the
time being, we only give the default codes - those from scancode set 2.)
Each key press and key release produces between 0 and 6 scancodes.

<sect1>Key release<p>
Below I'll only mention the scancode for key press (`make').
The scancode for key release (`break') is obtained from it
by setting the high order bit (adding 0x80 = 128).
Thus, Esc press produces scancode <bf>01</bf>, Esc release
scancode <bf>81</bf> (hex).
For sequences things are similar: Keypad-/ gives <bf>e0</bf> <bf>35</bf>
when pressed, <bf>e0</bf> <bf>b5</bf> when released. Most keyboards will
repeat the make code (key down code) when the key repeats. Some will also
fake Shift down and Shift up events during the repeat.

The keys PrtSc/SysRq and Pause/Break are special.
The former produces scancode <bf>e0</bf> <bf>2a</bf> <bf>e0</bf> <bf>37</bf>
when no modifier key is pressed simultaneously, <bf>e0</bf> <bf>37</bf>
together with Shift or Ctrl, but <bf>54</bf> together with (left or right) Alt.
The latter produces scancode sequence
<bf>e1</bf> <bf>1d</bf> <bf>45</bf> <bf>e1</bf> <bf>9d</bf> <bf>c5</bf>
when pressed (without modifier) and nothing at all upon release.
However, together with (left or right) Ctrl, one gets
<bf>e0</bf> <bf>46</bf> <bf>e0</bf> <bf>c6</bf>,
and again nothing at release. It does not repeat.


<sect1>Protocol scancodes<p>
Most scancodes indicate a key press or release.
Some are used in the communication protocol.
<p>
<bf>00</bf> (Keyboard buffer overflow or parity error)
<p>
<bf>aa</bf> (BAT [Basic Assurance Test] OK)
<p>
<bf>ee</bf> (Result of echo command)
<p>
<bf>f1</bf> (Some keyboards, as reply to command <bf>a4</bf>:
Password not installed)
<p>
<bf>fa</bf> (Ack)
<p>
<bf>fc</bf> (BAT error or Mouse transmit error)
<p>
<bf>fe</bf> (Keyboard fails to ack, please resend)
<p>
<bf>ff</bf> (Keyboard parity error)

<sect1>Escape scancodes<p>
The codes <bf>e0</bf> and <bf>e1</bf> introduce scancode sequences,
and are not usually used as isolated scancodes themselves
(but see <ref id="e0_as_key" name="below">).
<p>
This, and the above, means that scancodes
<bf>00</bf>, <bf>60</bf>, <bf>61</bf>, <bf>6e</bf>, <bf>71</bf>,
<bf>7a</bf>, <bf>7c</bf>, <bf>7e</bf>, <bf>7f</bf>
are unavailable to signify key presses (on a default keyboard;
we'll see keyboards that actually use scancode <bf>60</bf>).
<p>
Also other prefixes occur, see <ref id="prefix_80" name="below">.

<sect1>Ordinary scancodes<p>
The scancodes in scancode set 2 are given in hex.
Between parentheses the keycap on a US keyboard.
The scancodes are given in order, grouped according
to groups of keys that are usually found next to each other.
<p>
<bf>00</bf> is normally an error code
<p>
<bf>01</bf> (Esc)
<p>
<bf>02</bf> (1!), <bf>03</bf> (2@), <bf>04</bf> (3#), <bf>05</bf> (4$),
<bf>06</bf> (5%E), <bf>07</bf> (6^), <bf>08</bf> (7&amp;),
<bf>09</bf> (8*), <bf>0a</bf> (9(), <bf>0b</bf> (0)), <bf>0c</bf> (-_),

<p>
<bf>3a</bf> (CapsLock)
<p>
<bf>3b</bf> (F1), <bf>3c</bf> (F2), <bf>3d</bf> (F3), <bf>3e</bf> (F4),

<p>
<bf>54</bf> (Alt-SysRq) on a 84+ key keyboard
<p>
<bf>55</bf> is less common; occurs as PF1 on a Focus 9000 keyboard,
and as FN on an IBM ThinkPad.
<p>
<bf>56</bf> mostly on non-US keyboards. It is an unlabelled key
next to the space bar on a Toshiba notebook.
<p>
<bf>57</bf> (F11), <bf>58</bf> (F12) both on a 101+ key keyboard
<p>
<bf>59</bf>-<bf>5a</bf>-...-<bf>7f</bf> are less common.
Scancodes <bf>59</bf>-<bf>5c</bf> occur on the RC930 keyboard.
X calls <bf>5d</bf> `KEY_Begin'.
Scancodes <bf>55</bf>, <bf>6d</bf>, <bf>6f</bf>, <bf>73</bf>, <bf>74</bf>,
<bf>77</bf>, <bf>78</bf>, <bf>79</bf>, <bf>7a</bf>, <bf>7b</bf>,
<bf>7c</bf>, <bf>7e</bf> occur on the Focus 9000 keyboard.
Scancodes <bf>73</bf>, <bf>7d</bf> occur on a Japanese 86/106 keyboard.
<p>

<sect1>Escaped scancodes<p>
Apart from the Pause/Break key that has an escaped sequence starting
with <bf>e1</bf>, the escape used is <bf>e0</bf>. Often, the codes
are chosen in such a way that something meaningful happens when
the receiver just discards the <bf>e0</bf>.
<p>
<bf>e0</bf> <bf>1c</bf> (Keypad Enter) - <bf>1c</bf> (Enter)
<p>
<bf>e0</bf> <bf>1d</bf> (RCtrl) - <bf>1d</bf> (LCtrl)
<p>
<bf>e0</bf> <bf>2a</bf> (fake LShift) - <bf>2a</bf> (LShift)
<p>
<bf>e0</bf> <bf>35</bf> (Keypad-/) - <bf>35</bf> (/?)
<p>
<bf>e0</bf> <bf>36</bf> (fake RShift) - <bf>36</bf> (RShift)
<p>
<bf>e0</bf> <bf>37</bf> (Ctrl-PrtScn) - <bf>37</bf> (*/PrtScn)
<p>
<bf>e0</bf> <bf>38</bf> (RAlt) - <bf>38</bf> (LAlt)
<p>
<bf>e0</bf> <bf>46</bf> (Ctrl-Break) - <bf>46</bf> (ScrollLock)
<p>
<bf>e0</bf> <bf>47</bf> (Grey Home) - <bf>47</bf> (Keypad-7/Home)
<p>
<bf>e0</bf> <bf>48</bf> (Grey Up) - <bf>48</bf> (Keypad-8/UpArrow)
<p>
<bf>e0</bf> <bf>49</bf> (Grey PgUp) - <bf>49</bf> (Keypad-9/PgUp)
<p>
<bf>e0</bf> <bf>4b</bf> (Grey Left) - <bf>4b</bf> (Keypad-4/Left)
<p>
<bf>e0</bf> <bf>4d</bf> (Grey Right) - <bf>4d</bf> (Keypad-6/Right)
<p>
<bf>e0</bf> <bf>4f</bf> (Grey End) - <bf>4f</bf> (Keypad-1/End)
<p>
<bf>e0</bf> <bf>50</bf> (Grey Down) - <bf>50</bf> (Keypad-2/DownArrow)
<p>
<bf>e0</bf> <bf>51</bf> (Grey PgDn) - <bf>51</bf> (Keypad-3/PgDn)
<p>
<bf>e0</bf> <bf>52</bf> (Grey Insert) - <bf>52</bf> (Keypad-0/Ins)
<p>
<bf>e0</bf> <bf>53</bf> (Grey Delete) - <bf>53</bf> (Keypad-./Del)
<p>
These escaped scancodes occur only on 101+ key keyboards.

<sect1>Fake shifts<p>
The ten grey keys Insert, Home, PgUp, Delete, End, PgDn,
Up, Left, Down, Right are supposed to function regardless
of the state of Shift and NumLock keys. But for an old AT keyboard
the keypad keys would produce digits when Numlock was on or Shift
was down. Therefore, in order to fool old programs,
fake scancodes are sent: when LShift is down, and Insert is
pressed, <bf>e0</bf> <bf>aa</bf> <bf>e0</bf> <bf>52</bf> is sent;
upon release of Insert <bf>e0</bf> <bf>d2</bf> <bf>e0</bf> <bf>2a</bf>
is sent. In other words, a fake LShift-up and
fake LShift-down are inserted.

If the Shift key is released earlier than the repeated key,
then a real Shift-up code occurs (without preceding fake Shift-down)
so that a program ignoring <bf>e0</bf> would see one more Shift-up
than Shift-down.

When NumLock is on, no fake Shifts are sent when Shift was down,
but fake Shifts are sent when Shift was not down. Thus,
with Numlock, if Insert is pressed,
<bf>e0</bf> <bf>2a</bf> <bf>e0</bf> <bf>52</bf> is sent
and upon release <bf>e0</bf> <bf>d2</bf> <bf>e0</bf> <bf>aa</bf> is sent.
The keyboard maintains a private NumLock mode, toggled when
NumLock is pressed, and set when the NumLock LED is set.

In the same way, when Shift is down, the Grey-/ key produces
fake Shift-up and fake Shift-down sequences. However, it does
not react to the state of NumLock. The purpose of course is to
fool programs that identify Grey-/ with ordinary /, so that they
don't treat Shift-Grey-/ like Shift-/, i.e., ?.

On a Toshiba notebook, the three Windows keys are treated like
the group of ten keys mentioned, and get fake shifts when
(left or right) Shift is down. Thet do not react to NumLock.

<sect1>Turbo Mode<p>
On some motherboards the LCtrl-LAlt-GreyPlus and LCtrl-LAlt-GreyMinus
switch Turbo mode on/off, respectively. For these, the motherboard
may generate the same scancode sequence when the Turbo button is
pushed: Turbo Switch (High->Low):
<bf>1d</bf> <bf>38</bf> <bf>4a</bf> <bf>ce</bf> <bf>b8</bf> <bf>9d</bf>
and Turbo Switch (Low->High):
<bf>1d</bf> <bf>38</bf> <bf>4e</bf> <bf>ce</bf> <bf>b8</bf> <bf>9d</bf>.
<p>
Other peculiar combinations in this style include
LCtrl-LAlt-LShift-GreyMinus to turn off system cache.
<p>
Thio Yu Jin &lt;jin@singmail.com&gt; complains that on his Toshiba 4010CDS
the Ctrl-Alt-Shift-T key combination brings up the Toshiba user manual.

<sect1>Scancode modes
<label id="scancode_modes">
<p>
The usual PC keyboards are capable of producing three
sets of scancodes. Writing 0xf0 followed by 1, 2 or 3 to port
0x60 will put the keyboard in scancode mode 1, 2 or 3. Writing
0xf0 followed by 0 queries the mode, resulting in a scancode
byte 0x43, 0x41 or 0x3f from the keyboard.
<p>
Scancode mode 2 is the default. In this mode, a key press
usually produces a value <it>s</it> in the range 0x01-0x5f and the
corresponding key release produces <it>s</it>+0x80. In scancode
mode 3, the only key releases that produce a scan code are of
either Shift key, or of the left Ctrl and Alt keys; for all
other keys only the key presses are noted. The produced
scancodes are mostly equal to those for scancode mode 2.
<p>
In scancode mode 1 most key releases produce the same values as
in scancode mode 2, but for key presses there are entirely
different, unrelated values. The details are somewhat messy.

<sect>Special keyboards<p>

<sect1>Focus KeyPro FK-9000 keyboard<p>
Raul D. Miller &lt;rockwell@nova.umd.edu&gt;
and &lt;hagmanti@cps.msu.edu&gt; report:
<p>
<it>
The keyboard is a KeyPro FK-9000.  The FCC label says it's made in
Taiwan by Focus Electronic Co, Ltd.  It has a built-in calculator.
</it>
<p>
<it>
This keyboard has twelve additional keys, with scancodes
</it>
<bf>55</bf> (PF1),
<bf>6d</bf> (PF11),
<bf>6f</bf> (PF12),
<bf>73</bf> (PF2),
<bf>74</bf> (PF9),
<bf>77</bf> (PF3),
<bf>78</bf> (PF4),
<bf>79</bf> (PF5),
<bf>7a</bf>* (PF6),
<bf>7b</bf> (PF7),
<bf>7c</bf> (PF8),
<bf>7e</bf>* (PF10).
<p>
<it>
The break codes equal the make codes ORed with 0x80, as always,
but the Linux kernel eats <bf>fa</bf> and <bf>fe</bf> as
protocol bytes.
</it>
<p>
<it>
The behavior of these keys is different from that of normal keys--
they generate nothing when pressed; then generate the above scancodes
at the normal repeat time and rate, and then generate (except for the
starred ones) their scancode ORed with 0x80 when released...
</it>
<p>
<it>
These PF keys are reprogrammable -- and programming occurs as a sequence
of keyboard actions.  Therefore, the PF keys duplicate whatever
keyboard actions occurred during their programming.
You hit the "Prog" key, then the PF key you want to program; type the
string you want to store in the key (it's limited to 14 keypresses),
and then hit the PF key again. After that, when you hit the PF key,
it sends the string, and generates its own abnormal scancode upon
release. When the key is held down, it generates the scancode repeatedly,
but does not generate the string stored in it repeatedly.
</it>
<p>
<it>
When you go to program a key, the scancodes for "PF##-" are sent
to the computer, then the scancodes for each key you hit as you
hit it (the shift, etc. keys are an exception-- they send "s-"
and such :), and then, when you hit the PF## key again to end the
programming, it sends a sequence of (at least) 18 "0e 8e"s --
Backspaces...
</it>
<p>
<it>
The program key itself doesn't generate a scancode at any time.
The same applies to the CE and AC/ON keys (part of the calculator).
There is a switch to change between calculator and keyboard mode
which generates no scancodes.
</it>
<p>
<it>
When the keyboard is in calculator mode, the entire numeric
keypad (and everything else on the right side) generates no
scancodes.
</it>
<p>
<it>
When the keyboard is not in caluclator mode, the %, MC, MR, M-,
M+, and Square Root keys all generate 0xff when pressed,
0xff to repeat, and 0xff on release.
</it>
<p>
<it>
The little unlabeled key between the right Ctrl and right Alt
generates <bf>56</bf> when hit, repeats that, and then <bf>d6</bf>
when released, just like a normal key.
</it>
<p>

<sect1>BTC keyboard<p>
This keyboard has one additional key, with escaped scancode
<bf>e0</bf> <bf>6f</bf> (Macro).

<sect1>LK450 keyboard<p>
This keyboard has six additional keys, with escaped scancodes

<sect1>OmniKey keyboard<p>
This keyboard has one additional key, with escaped scancode
<bf>e0</bf> <bf>4c</bf> (Omni).

<sect1>GRiD 2260 keyboard<p>
The GRiD 2260 notebook has a key producing the
<bf>6c</bf> scancode; I do not know the keycap.

<sect1>A Japanese 86/106 keyboard<p>
Barry Yip &lt;g609296@cc.win.or.jp&gt; reports:
<p>
<it>
This keyboard has two additional keys, with scancodes
<bf>73</bf> (\-) and <bf>7d</bf> (\|).
This kind of keyboard is rather standard in Japan. They are called 106
keyboard. Mine is a notebook so it is 86 keyboard. No specific brand
name.
</it>

<sect1>Brazilian keyboard<p>
Arnaldo Moura &lt;lumbago@vnet.ibm.com&gt; reports:
<p>
<it>
This keyboard has two unusual keys, with scancodes
<bf>73</bf> (/?) and <bf>7e</bf> (Keypad-.).
</it>
<p>
Also others mention an ABNT keyboard with <bf>73</bf> and
<bf>7e</bf> keys, mostly because these keys do not function
with Windows NT 4.0.
<p>
ABNT (Associação Brasileira de Normas Tecnicas) and ABNT2
are Brazilian keyboard layout standards. The plain Brazilian
keyboard has 103 keys. I find an ABNT 107 key keyboard announced by
<htmlurl name="gertec" url="http://www.gertec.com.br/tecpc1.htm">.
with Suspend / Wake-up / Power power management keys.
<it>For enabling these functions, run BIOS setup.</it>

<sect1>RC930 keyboard<p>
Torben Fjerdingstad &lt;tfj@olivia.ping.dk&gt; reports:
<p>
<it>
It's an rc930 keyboard, from Regnecentralen/RC International, Now ICL.
This keyboard has four additional keys, with scancodes
</it>
<bf>59</bf> (A1),
<bf>5a</bf> (A2),
<bf>5b</bf> (A3),
<bf>5c</bf> (A4).
<p>
<it>
The rc930/rc931 keyboards are not made anymore, because they had a
problem with fast typists, writing over 400 chars/minute.
Writing 'af&lt;space&gt;', very, very fast, did a PgUp.

I recently came into possession of a 97-key keyboard with Japanese
markings on the keys.  (The keys also have the standard
qwerty-characters on them, with the exception of some of the meta-keys
(there are 3 keys near the Alt keys on either side of the spacebar with
only Japanese characters on them so I don't know what they are).
In any case, the keyboard sends out scancodes that work for all the main
keys (backspace, letters and numbers, enter, shift), but the numeric
keypad, Alt keys, and function keys don't work.
I have run the board through <tt>showkey -s</tt>, so I know what
scancodes this keyboard sends out.
However, the F9 and F10 keys send out <bf>60</bf> and <bf>61</bf>,
respectively, so their key release events send out <bf>e0</bf>
and <bf>e1</bf>, confusing the keyboard driver.

There are more keyboards that do not use <bf>e0</bf> as escape code.
For example, Paul Schulz &lt;pauls@caemrad.com.au&gt;
reports the same for Sun Type 5 Keyboard with PS/2 connector,
NCD model N-123NA. A kernel patch is required for such keyboards.

I have an IBM ThinkPad i1460. It has the IBM EasyLaunch&lt;tm&gt; keys.
These are four multicoloured keys up at the top of the keyboard
for "Home Page", "Search", "Shop", "Mail".  They dont' seem to create
any keyboard events at all.  The keyboard interrupt doesn't trigger,
<tt>showkeys</tt> doesn't see them do anything, and in DOS, a simple
sequence of BIOS calls doesn't see them either.
Also, being a laptop, it has an FN key.  This key generates <bf>55</bf>.

<sect1>Keyboards with many keys<p>
The current mechanism is unable to handle keyboards with more than
127 keys. But such keyboards seem to exist. (So far, nobody has
reported `I have one', but there are several reports saying
`I have heard about someone who has one'.)

On some ADB keyboards there are actually 128 distinct keys.
They use scancodes 0-127.
</it><p><it>
ADB is Apple Desktop Bus.  The way that ADB works is similar to SCSI but
on a much slower level.  Specifically there is a communications chip in
the computer, ADB controller, and the same chip in the keyboard.  The
keyboard sends the scancode to its internal ADB controller, the internal
ADB controller then does any key mapping needed (not used under linux
from my understanding) and passes the data to the computer.
</it><p><it>
The ADB controller is capable of sending 256 distinct keys, but to my
knowledge only 128 are sent.  The key 0 is the 'a' and key 127 is the
"power button".
</it><p><it>
Also some of the Apple ADB keyboards have special "sound" and "function"
keys.  These keys (used in MacOS for volume up and down, screen contrast
changing, etc) also show up on the ADB scancodes.
</it><p><it>
ADB is used for both m68k and PPC Linux.  The m68k Macintosh port, and
the PPC - Power Macintosh and CHRP ports.
</it><p>
and later:
<p><it>
Basically the scancode sequences for ADB are 16 bit. so there can actually
be 65536 scancodes, currently though only 128 are defined.
</it>

<sect>Reporting<p>
Additions and corrections are welcome.
Use <tt>showkey -s</tt> to get the scancodes.
Mention keyboard manufacturer and type, and the keycaps.
