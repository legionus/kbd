These maps are as contributed. Use at your own risk.
(But please tell me if something is seriously wrong.)
Mail corrections, improvements and new maps to aeb@cwi.nl.

Several corrections were pointed out by Tom.Kartes@Materna.DE.

mk_modmap is a utility that might help synchronizing
your keymaps for loadkeys and for xmodmap (but note that
(since version 2.1 of XFree86) X initialises its keymap using
the Linux keymap, so that xmodmap will often be superfluous).

Since version 0.87, put a line `charset "iso-8859-x"' in front
of a map, when you are using symbols outside iso-8859-1.

Since version 0.88, put a line `keymaps 0-1,4-5,8,12' or so
in front of a map, in order to indicate what keymaps should
be used.

hypermap.m4 was contributed by shields@tembel.org (Michael Shields).
Use: m4 hypermap.m4 | loadkeys .

Please, if you submit something that includes compose key
combinations, uuencode the keymap, since SMTP-compliant
mailers will strip the eighth bit.
