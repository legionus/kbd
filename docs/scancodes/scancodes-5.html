			<h2><a name="s5">5. Special keyboards - MF II keyboards</a></h2>
		</div>

		<p>Next the modern keyboards. (MF stands for MultiFunctional.)
		The layout has changed: the function keys now form a top row.
		Function keys F11 and F12 were added. The ten keypad digit keys
		that served dual purposes (depending on NumLock and Shift)
		were duplicated so that digits and cursor movements could be
		produced without help from the Shift or Numlock keys.
		Also the Alt and Ctrl keys were duplicated.
		Prefixes <b>e0</b> <i>and</i> <b>e1</b> were introduced
		to distinguish old and new versions of the same old key.
		All modern keyboards follow this scheme, but many add a messy
		collection of "internet buttons" and "CD keys".</p>

		<p>For keyboards with "Internet keys", see the next section.</p>

			<h3><a name="nokia"></a><a name="ss5.1">5.1 Nokia keyboard</a></h3>
		</div>

		<p>This 121-key <a href="nokia.jpg">Nokia keyboard</a>
		has ten function keys on the left and twenty-four on
		the two top rows. On the right a block with cursor keys
		and a block with numeric keys. There are three LEDs.
		The keys have brown markings, and sometimes also blue ones.
		Where both occur, the blue markings describe the usual PC keytops.</p>
		
		<p>Roughly speaking, the scancodes are as expected.
		The <a href="nokia-top.jpg">function keys</a> F1-F10,F11,F12
		have scan codes <b>3b</b>-<b>44</b>, <b>57</b>, <b>58</b> as usual.
		The keys on the upper row, labeled F13-F24, yield the same codes as
		shifted F1-F12. E.g., F13 gives <b>2a</b> <b>3b</b> on press,
		and <b>bb</b> <b>aa</b> on release.
		The function keys F4,F11,F13-F19,F21,F24 have front labels
		CrSel, AltCr, Red, Pink, Green, Yellow, Blue, Turq, White,
		Col, USM.</p>

		<p>The <a href="nokia-left.jpg">ten keys on the left</a>
		have the following scancodes.
		First column of five:
		<b>01</b> (Attn/Esc/NxtTsk), as expected for Esc;
		<b>1d 3b</b> (Quit/Reset), as expected for Ctrl F1;
		<b>1d 3c</b> (ExSel), as expected for Ctrl F2;
		<b>1d 3d</b> (Ident/Print), as expected for Ctrl F3;
		<b>1d 3e</b> (Help/EnlW), as expected for Ctrl F4.
		For these last four keys (and the ChgSc/WSCtrl below) the code
		becomes <b>3b</b>-<b>3e</b> (and <b>3f</b>) when left or right
		Ctrl is pressed already.
		Second column of five:
		<b>e1 1d 45</b> ((Break)/Clear/Pause/Test), and <b>e0 46</b>
		with Ctrl, as expected for Pause/Break;
		<b>46</b> (ScrLock), as expected for ScrLock;
		<b>e0 2a e0 37</b> (PrtSc/SysRq), and <b>e0 37</b> with
		left or right Ctrl or left or right Shift, and <b>54</b>
		with left or right Alt, as expected for PrtSc;
		<b>1d 3f</b> (ChgSc/WSCtrl), as expected for Ctrl F5;
		<b>38 e0 49</b> (Jump), as expected for Alt PgUp.</p>

		<p>On <a href="nokia-right.jpg">the right</a> a cursor key
		section and a number pad.
		The cursor key section has the expected block of six:
		<b>e0 52</b> (Dup/Insert/PA1);
		<b>e0 47</b> (Field Mark/Home/PA2);
		<b>e0 49</b> (PA3/PgUp);
		<b>e0 53</b> (Delete/DelWd);
		<b>e0 4f</b> (ErEOF/End/ErInp);
		<b>e0 51</b> (PgDn).
		Next four arrow keys:
		<b>e0 48</b> (Up);
		<b>e0 4b</b> (Left);
		<b>e0 4d</b> (Right);
		<b>e0 50</b> (Down).
		And in the middle <b>1d 40</b> (Home), with code as expected for Ctrl F6.</p>

		<p>Finally the numeric keypad, with the usual keys that generate the
		usual codes, and a single additional key, a Tab, with <b>0f</b>
		like the ordinary tab.</p>

			<h3><a name="focus"></a><a name="ss5.2">5.2 Focus KeyPro FK-9000 keyboard</a></h3>
		</div>

		<p>Raul D. Miller &lt;<code>rockwell@nova.umd.edu</code>&gt;
		and Timothy C. Hagman &lt;<code>hagmanti@cps.msu.edu</code>&gt;
		report:</p>

		<p>The keyboard is a KeyPro FK-9000.  The FCC label says it's made in
		Taiwan by Focus Electronic Co, Ltd.  It has a built-in calculator.</p>

		<p>This keyboard has twelve additional keys, with scancodes
		<b>55</b> (PF1),
		<b>6d</b> (PF11),
		<b>6f</b> (PF12),
		<b>73</b> (PF2),
		<b>74</b> (PF9),
		<b>77</b> (PF3),
		<b>78</b> (PF4),
		<b>79</b> (PF5),
		<b>7a</b>* (PF6),
		<b>7b</b> (PF7),
		<b>7c</b> (PF8),
		<b>7e</b>* (PF10).</p>

		<p>The break codes equal the make codes ORed with 0x80, as always,
		but the Linux kernel eats <b>fa</b> and <b>fe</b> as
		protocol bytes.</p>

		<p>The behavior of these keys is different from that of normal keys--
		they generate nothing when pressed; then generate the above scancodes
		at the normal repeat time and rate, and then generate (except for the
		starred ones) their scancode ORed with 0x80 when released...</p>

		<p>These PF keys are reprogrammable -- and programming occurs as a sequence
		of keyboard actions.  Therefore, the PF keys duplicate whatever
		keyboard actions occurred during their programming.
		You hit the "Prog" key, then the PF key you want to program; type the
		string you want to store in the key (it's limited to 14 keypresses),
		and then hit the PF key again. After that, when you hit the PF key,
		it sends the string, and generates its own abnormal scancode upon
		release. When the key is held down, it generates the scancode repeatedly,
		but does not generate the string stored in it repeatedly.</p>

		<p>When you go to program a key, the scancodes for "PF##-" are sent
		to the computer, then the scancodes for each key you hit as you
		hit it (the shift, etc. keys are an exception-- they send "s-"
		and such :), and then, when you hit the PF## key again to end the
		programming, it sends a sequence of (at least) 18 "0e 8e"s --
		Backspaces...</p>

		<p>The program key itself doesn't generate a scancode at any time.
		The same applies to the CE and AC/ON keys (part of the calculator).
		There is a switch to change between calculator and keyboard mode
		which generates no scancodes.</p>

		<p>When the keyboard is in calculator mode, the entire numeric
		keypad (and everything else on the right side) generates no
		scancodes.</p>

		<p>When the keyboard is not in caluclator mode, the %, MC, MR, M-,
		M+, and Square Root keys all generate <b>ff</b> when pressed,
		<b>ff</b> to repeat, and <b>ff</b> on release.</p>

		<p>The little unlabeled key between the right Ctrl and right Alt
		generates <b>56</b> when hit, repeats that, and then <b>d6</b>
		when released, just like a normal key.</p>

		<b>e0</b> <b>6f</b> (Macro). (Funny enough it does this
		in all modes, each of the three scancode sets, translated or not.
		In particular, this Macro key is the only key that generates

		<p>The Safeway SW10 keyboard has the usual keys, including the three
		Windows keys, and including Power, Sleep, Wake keys
		(below Delete, End, PageDown) that do not produce scancodes
		unless the Fn key (above Keypad-Minus) is pressed simultaneously.
		This Fn key is used together with 11 keys: F1-F7, F11, Power, Sleep, Wake.
		Fn-F11 disables the keyboard and another Fn-F11 enables it again.
		Fn-F1/F2/F3/F4/F5/F6/F7 sets the repeat rate
		(on my keyboard I measured 2.0/4.0/6.7/12/26/32/32 chars/sec respectively).</p>

			<h3><a name="ss5.17">5.17 A nameless USB keyboard</a></h3>
		</div>

		<p>This keyboard has four additional keys: Power (rose), Sleep (blue),

		In legacy mode these keys give the expected keycodes
		(<b>e0</b> <b>5e</b>, <b>e0</b> <b>5f</b>, <b>e0</b> <b>63</b>,
		and none, respectively), but the interaction is funny.
		The four keys act as radiobuttons. Pressing one yields its key down code,
		but releasing it does not produce any scancodes. Now pressing another
		yields the down code for the other followed by the up code for the
		previous one. The FN key follows this pattern, only its scancode sequence
		is empty. Thus, pressing it causes the release code for a previous key
		to be emitted. Pressing a key a second time gives no reaction: the radiobutton
		was down already.</p>

		<p>On some ADB keyboards there are actually 128 distinct keys.
		They use scancodes 0-127.</p>

		<p>ADB is Apple Desktop Bus.  The way that ADB works is similar to SCSI but
		on a much slower level.  Specifically there is a communications chip in
		the computer, ADB controller, and the same chip in the keyboard.  The
		keyboard sends the scancode to its internal ADB controller, the internal
		ADB controller then does any key mapping needed (not used under linux
		from my understanding) and passes the data to the computer.</p>

		<p>The ADB controller is capable of sending 256 distinct keys, but to my
		knowledge only 128 are sent.  The key 0 is the 'a' and key 127 is the
		"power button".</p>

		<p>Also some of the Apple ADB keyboards have special "sound" and "function"
		keys.  These keys (used in MacOS for volume up and down, screen contrast
		changing, etc) also show up on the ADB scancodes.</p>

		<p>ADB is used for both m68k and PPC Linux.  The m68k Macintosh port, and
		the PPC - Power Macintosh and CHRP ports.</p>

		<p>and later:</p>

		<p>Basically the scancode sequences for ADB are 16 bit. so there can actually
		be 65536 scancodes, currently though only 128 are defined.</p>
