			<h3><a name="s13">13. The PS/2 Mouse</a></h3>
		</div>

		<p>Mice come in various flavours - serial mice, PS/2 mice, busmice, USB mice.
		Below a little about mice using the PS/2 protocol, since these also use
		the keyboard controller.</p>

		<p>A mouse has a number of buttons (1-5 is common) and must report
		button presses. It has some way of detecting motion, and must report
		the amount of movement in the X and Y direction, usually as differences
		with the previously reported position, in a (dx,dy) pair.
		Touchpads can also report absolute position.</p>

		<p>Reports come in the form of mouse packets of between 1 and 8 bytes.
		Various protocols are in use.</p>

		<div class="page-header">
			<h3><a name="mousemodes"></a> <a name="ss13.1">13.1 Modes</a></h3>
		</div>

		<p>A PS/2 mouse can be in <i>stream mode</i> (the default).
		In this mode it produces a stream of packets indicating mouse movements
		and button presses. Or it can be in <i>remote mode</i>.
		In this mode the mouse only sends a packet when the host
		requests one, using the <b>
		<a href="#mceb">eb</a></b> command.
		Finally, it can be in <i>echo</i> ("wrap") <i>mode</i>,
		in which everything the host sends is echoed back, until
		either a reset (<b>ff</b>) or clear echo mode (<b>ec</b>)
		is received.</p>

		<div class="page-header">
			<h3><a name="ss13.2">13.2 Scaling</a></h3>
		</div>

		<p>Scaling can be set to 1:1 or 2:1. This affects stream mode only.
		In 2:1 scaling: If the unscaled absolute value of dx or dy is 6 or more,
		it is doubled. Otherwise, for the unscaled value 0,1,2,3,4,5,6, the
		scaled value 0,1,1,3,6,9,12 is sent.</p>

		<div class="page-header">
			<h3><a name="ss13.3">13.3 PS/2 mouse protocol</a></h3>
		</div>

		<h4>The default protocol</h4>

		<p>The standard PS/2 protocol uses 3-byte packets, as follows:</p>

		<table class="table table-bordered">
		<tr><td>
		Yovfl</td>
		<td>Xovfl</td>
		<td>dy8</td>
		<td>dx8</td>
		<td>1</td>
		<td>Middle Btn</td>
		<td>Right Btn</td>
		<td>Left Btn</td>
		</tr>
		<tr><td>
		dx7</td>
		<td>dx6</td>
		<td>dx5</td>
		<td>dx4</td>
		<td>dx3</td>
		<td>dx2</td>
		<td>dx1</td>
		<td>dx0</td>
		</tr>
		<tr><td>
		dy7</td>
		<td>dy6</td>
		<td>dy5</td>
		<td>dy4</td>
		<td>dy3</td>
		<td>dy2</td>
		<td>dy1</td>
		<td>dy0</td>
		</tr>
		</table>

		<p>It gives the movement in the X and Y direction in 9-bit two's complement
		notation (range -256 to +255) and an overflow indicator.
		It also gives the status of the three mouse buttons.
		When this protocol is used, the <b>f2</b> Read mouse ID command
		is answered by <b>00</b>.</p>

		<h4>Intellimouse</h4>

		<p>The Microsoft Intellimouse uses the above protocol until scrolling wheel
		mode is activated by sending the magic sequence
		<b>f3</b> <b>c8</b> <b>f3</b> <b>64</b> <b>f3</b> <b>50</b>
		(set sample rate 200, 100, 80). In this mode, the Read mouse ID command
		returns <b>03</b>, and 4-byte packets are used:</p>

		<table class="table table-bordered">
		<tr><td>
		Yovfl</td>
		<td>Xovfl</td>
		<td>dy8</td>
		<td>dx8</td>
		<td>1</td>
		<td>Middle Btn</td>
		<td>Right Btn</td>
		<td>Left Btn</td>
		</tr>
		<tr><td>
		dx7</td>
		<td>dx6</td>
		<td>dx5</td>
		<td>dx4</td>
		<td>dx3</td>
		<td>dx2</td>
		<td>dx1</td>
		<td>dx0</td>
		</tr>
		<tr><td>
		dy7</td>
		<td>dy6</td>
		<td>dy5</td>
		<td>dy4</td>
		<td>dy3</td>
		<td>dy2</td>
		<td>dy1</td>
		<td>dy0</td>
		</tr>
		<tr><td>
		dz3</td>
		<td>dz3</td>
		<td>dz3</td>
		<td>dz3</td>
		<td>dz3</td>
		<td>dz2</td>
		<td>dz1</td>
		<td>dz0</td>
		</tr>
		</table>

		<p>Here the last byte gives the movement of the scrolling wheel in
		4-bit two's complement notation (range -8 to +7) and the leading
		four bits are just copies of the sign bit.</p>

		<h4>Intellimouse Explorer mouse</h4>

		<p>The Explorer mouse protocol allows for scrolling wheel and five buttons.
		It is activated by first sending the magic sequence for Intellimouse,
		and then, when the Intellimouse ID has been seen, sending the magic sequence
		<b>f3</b> <b>c8</b> <b>f3</b> <b>c8</b> <b>f3</b> <b>50</b>
		(set sample rate 200, 200, 80). In this mode, the Read mouse ID command
		returns <b>04</b>, and 4-byte packets are used:</p>

		<table class="table table-bordered">
		<tr><td>
		Yovfl</td>
		<td>Xovfl</td>
		<td>dy8</td>
		<td>dx8</td>
		<td>1</td>
		<td>Middle Btn</td>
		<td>Right Btn</td>
		<td>Left Btn</td>
		</tr>
		<tr><td>
		dx7</td>
		<td>dx6</td>
		<td>dx5</td>
		<td>dx4</td>
		<td>dx3</td>
		<td>dx2</td>
		<td>dx1</td>
		<td>dx0</td>
		</tr>
		<tr><td>
		dy7</td>
		<td>dy6</td>
		<td>dy5</td>
		<td>dy4</td>
		<td>dy3</td>
		<td>dy2</td>
		<td>dy1</td>
		<td>dy0</td>
		</tr>
		<tr><td>
		0</td>
		<td>0</td>
		<td>5th Btn</td>
		<td>4th Btn</td>
		<td>dz3</td>
		<td>dz2</td>
		<td>dz1</td>
		<td>dz0</td>
		</tr>
		</table>

		<p>Lots of other protocols occur, and only incomplete data is known
		about most of them. Some examples.</p>

		<h4>Typhoon mouse</h4>

		<p>The Typhoon optical mouse is reported to send 6-byte packets.
		Bytes 1-3 are as for the default PS/2 protocol.
		Byte 4 equals byte 1. Byte 5 gives the Z axis movement, one of
		<b>ff</b>, <b>00</b>, <b>01</b>. Byte 6 is 0.
		Of course the idea is that this packet looks like two ordinary packets
		and ordinary PS/2 mouse drivers will handle it.
		The 6-byte mode is activated by sending the magic sequence
		<b>f3</b> <b>c8</b> <b>f3</b> <b>64</b> <b>f3</b> <b>50</b>
		<b>f3</b> <b>3c</b> <b>f3</b> <b>28</b> <b>f3</b> <b>14</b>
		(set sample rate 200, 100, 80, 60, 40, 20).
		It is recognized by the ID <b>08</b>.</p>

		<div class="page-header">
			<h3><a name="ss13.4">13.4 Mouse Commands</a></h3>
		</div>

		<p>Every command or data byte sent to the mouse (except for the
		resend command <b>fe</b>) is ACKed with <b>fa</b>.
		If the command or data is invalid, it is NACKed with <b>fe</b>.
		If the next byte is again invalid, the reply is ERROR: <b>fc</b>.</p>

			<h3><a name="sliced"></a> <a name="ss13.5">13.5 Sliced parameters</a></h3>
		</div>

		<p>For more advanced mouse modes it is necessary to send data to the mouse.
		There is now a commonly accepted way.</p>

		<p>First Logitech tried to use the <b>d1</b> command followed by an
		arbitrary data sequence.
		While the IBM specs reserve <b>d1</b>-<b>df</b> for vendor unique commands,
		it turns out that not all BIOSes will transmit such codes.
		So Logitech drops the <b>d1</b> and uses the sequence
		<b>e8</b> <i>aa</i> <b>e8</b> <i>bb</i> <b>e8</b> <i>cc</i>
		<b>e8</b> <i>dd</i> to transmit the byte <i>aabbccdd</i>, where
		<i>aa</i>, <i>bb</i>, <i>cc</i>, <i>dd</i> are 2-bit quantities.
		In this way an arbitrarily long sequence of bytes can be transmitted.</p>

		<p>For synchronization purposes it is possible to separate such groups
		of four <b>e8</b> commands by an <b>e6</b> command.
		Indeed, such separation may be required: Synaptics Touchpads react to
		<b>e9</b> or <b>f3</b> commands preceded by precisely four
		<b>e8</b> commands.</p>

		<h4>Magic knock</h4>

		<p>For example, the "magic knock" <b>d1</b> <b>39</b> <b>db</b>
		that sets a device that understands it in PS/2++ mode,
		becomes <b>e8</b> <b>00</b> <b>e8</b> <b>03</b>
		<b>e8</b> <b>02</b> <b>e8</b> <b>01</b> <b>e6</b>
		<b>e8</b> <b>03</b> <b>e8</b> <b>01</b>
		<b>e8</b> <b>02</b> <b>e8</b> <b>03</b>,
		abbreviated {E8}0321 {E6} {E8}3123.
		Note that 0321 and 3123 do not have repeated symbols. If they had,
		too intelligent intermediate hardware transmitting these sequences
		might see a superfluous command and suppress it.</p>

		<h4>Magic unknock</h4>

		<p>PS/2++ mode is cleared again by the "magic unknock"
		{E8} 0323 or D1 3B from an external device, and
		{E8} 0321 or D1 39 from an internal device.
		(These commands differ so that in setups where the same commands are
		sent to internal and external devices, they can be commanded separately.)</p>

		<p>For a decription of the PS/2++ format, see
		<a href="http://www.dqcs.com/logitech/ps2ppspec.htm">ps2ppspec.htm</a>.</p>

		<div class="page-header">

		</div>

		<p>A few sketchy details. For nice precise information, get
		the <a href="http://www.synaptics.com/decaf/utilities/ACF126.pdf">Synaptics interfacing guide</a>.</p>

		<h4>Status request</h4>

		<p>When preceded by an 8-bit request number encoded via four
		<b>
		<a href="#mce8">e8</a></b>
		commands, the <b>
		<a href="#mce9">e9</a></b> status request
		returns modified output, somewhat dependent on the Touchpad model.</p>

		<p><i>Request <b>00</b>: Identify Touchpad</i></p>

		<p>This request returns three bytes, of which the middle one
		is the constant <b>47</b>. This is the way to recognize
		a Touchpad. The low order four bits of the third word contain
		the major model version number, the first word contains the
		minor version number, and the high order four bits of the
		third word contain the (obsolete) model code.</p>

		<p><i>Request <b>01</b>: Read Touchpad Modes</i></p>

		<p>This request returns three bytes, of which the first two
		are the constants <b>3b</b> and <b>47</b>.
		The last byte is the mode byte</p>

		<table class="table table-bordered">
		<tr><td>
		ABS</td>
		<td>Rate</td>
		<td>-</td>
		<td>-</td>
		<td>Baud/Sleep</td>
		<td>DisGest</td>
		<td>PackSize</td>
		<td>Wmode</td>
		</tr>
		</table>

		<p>Here ABS indicates <i>absolute mode</i> (instead of the default
		relative mode).</p>

		<p>Rate is 0 for 40 packets/sec, 1 for 80 packets/sec.
		The PS/2 sampling rate value is ignored.</p>

		<p>Baud/Sleep indicates the baud rate when used with a serial protocol
		(0: 1200 baud, 1: 9600 baud). It must be set whenever ABS or Rate is set.
		When used with the PS/2 protocol this bit indicates <i>sleep mode</i> -
		a low power mode in which finger activity is ignored and only button
		presses are reported.</p>

		<p>DisGest is the "disable gestures" bit. When set, we have classical
		mouse behaviour. When cleared, "tap" and "drag" processing is enabled.</p>

		<p>PackSize is used for the serial protocol only (and then chooses between
		6-, 7- and 8-byte packets, also depending on the Wmode bit).</p>

		<p>Wmode is used in absolute mode only. When set the packets also
		contain the W value. (This value indicates the amount of contact:
		0: two-finger contact, 1: three-finger contact, 2: pen contact,
		3: reserved, 4-7: ordinary finger contact, 8-15: wide finger or palm contact.)</p>

		<p>This described Touchpad 4.x. Earlier models had up to four mode bytes.
		This request would return mode bytes 1 and 2 in the first and last result byte,
		and request <b>02</b> would return mode bytes 3 and 4.</p>

		<p><i>Request <b>02</b>: Read Capabilities</i></p>

		<p>This request returns three bytes, of which the middle one is
		the constant <b>47</b>. The first and third byte are the high-order
		and low-order parts of the capability word.
		(Thus on Touchpad 4.x. On earlier models mode bytes 3 and 4 are returned.)</p>

		<p>This capability word has 16 bits. Bit 15 indicates that capabilities
		are supported. Bit 4 indicates that Sleep is supported (for the PS/2
		protocol). Bit 3 indicates that four buttons (Left, Right, Up, Down)
		are supported. Bit 1 indicates that multi-finger detection is supported.
		Bit 0 indicates that palm detection is supported.</p>

		<p><i>Request <b>03</b>: Read Model ID</i></p>

		<p><i>Request <b>06</b>: Read Serial Number Prefix</i></p>

		<p><i>Request <b>07</b>: Read Serial Number Suffix</i></p>

		<p><i>Request <b>08</b>: Read Resolution</i></p>

		<h4>Mode setting</h4>

		<p>When preceded by an 8-bit request number encoded via four <b>e8</b>
		commands, the <b>
		<a href="#mcf3">f3</a></b> <b>14</b>
		(set sample rate 20) command sets the mode byte to the
		encoded number. (Thus on Touchpads 4.x. Older models have more mode
		bytes and several such commands.)</p>

		<div class="page-header">
			<h3><a name="ss13.7">13.7 Vendor extensions</a></h3>
		</div>

		<p>There is a complicated forest of "magic sequences" that enable
		vendor extensions. Recognizing all of these is a very obscure activity.</p>

		<p>(Moreover, recognizing these may be counterproductive:
		if the mouse has special capabilities which are activated
		by a special sequence, and it is connected to the computer
		via a KVM switch that does not know about this special protocol,
		then switching away and back will leave the mouse in the non-special
		state. This leads to non-functioning mice.)</p>

		<p>A 2002 Logitech file describes the following procedure for recognizing
		the mouse type:</p>

		<p>Stage 1: Send <b>ff</b>: reset.
		The reply is ignored. (Most common is <b>aa</b> <b>00</b>.)</p>

		<p>Stage 2: Send <b>f3</b> <b>0a</b> <b>f2</b>: set sample rate
		and ask for ID. If the reply is <b>02</b>, we have a trackball -
		it has its own protocol. (The usual reply is <b>00</b>.)</p>

		<p>Stage 3: Send <b>e8</b> <b>00</b> <b>e6</b> <b>e6</b> <b>e6</b>
		<b>e9</b>: set resolution and scaling (three times), and request status.
		The reply consists of three bytes <i>s1</i> <i>s2</i> <i>s3</i>.
		An old-fashioned mouse would report 0 in the second status byte <i>s2</i>
		(since that is the resolution and we just set it).</p>

		<p>If <i>s2</i> is nonzero then: <i>s2</i> is the number of buttons,
		<i>s3</i> is the firmware revision,
		<i>s1</i> has the firmware ID (device type) bits 6-0 in bits 3-0,6-4,
		while bit 7 of s1 indicates support for the
		<b>e7</b> <b>e7</b> <b>e7</b> <b>e9</b> command.</p>

		<p>If <i>s1</i>=<b>d0</b> and <i>s2</i>=<b>03</b> and
		<i>s3</i>=<b>c8</b>, suspect Synaptics.</p>

		<p>If <i>s1</i> and <i>s2</i> are zero but <i>s3</i> equals <b>0a</b>,
		suspect Alps. (<i>s3</i>=<b>0a</b> is as expected, but <i>s1</i>=0
		is not)</p>

		<p>Stage 4: If bit 7 of <i>s1</i> is set, or if we suspect Alps,
		send <b>e8</b> <b>00</b> <b>e7</b> <b>e7</b> <b>e7</b> <b>e9</b>:
		set resolution and scaling (three times), and request status.
		The reply consists of three bytes <i>t1</i> <i>t2</i> <i>t3</i>.
		Of course, we already know that this is not an old-fashioned mouse.</p>

		<p>If <i>t2</i>=<b>01</b> and FirmwareID &lt; 0x10 and
		<i>t1</i> &gt;&gt; 6 = 1, then conclude that we have a
		Cordless MouseMan (RA12).</p>

		<p>If <i>t2</i>=<b>01</b> and FirmwareID &lt; 0x10 and
		<i>t1</i> &gt;&gt; 6 = 3, then conclude that we have a
		Cordless MouseMan (RB24).</p>

		<p>Other cases with <i>t2</i>=<b>01</b> are for new cordless mice.</p>

		<p>If we suspect Synaptics and <i>t2</i>=0 and <i>t3</i>=<b>0a</b>,
		then conclude that we have a Synaptics touchpad.</p>

		<p>If we suspect Alps and <i>t1</i>=<b>33</b>, then conclude that
		we have an Alps touchpad.</p>

		<p>Stage 5: If we don't know the type yet, send <b>f3</b> <b>c8</b>
		<b>f3</b> <b>64</b> <b>f3</b> <b>50</b> <b>f2</b>:
		Set sampling rate to 200, 100, 80 Hz, and ask for ID.
		The reply is a single byte.
		If we get 3, conclude that we have an IntelliMouse.
		(And this sequence is the initialization sequence for the IntelliMouse.)</p>

		<p>Stage 6: Send <b>ff</b>: reset. Now the device is no longer in any
		special state.</p>

		<p>Stage 7: If we don't know the type yet, send <b>e8</b> <b>00</b>
		<b>e8</b> <b>00</b> <b>e8</b> <b>00</b> <b>e8</b> <b>00</b>
		<b>e9</b>: set resolution to 0 (four times), and ask for status.
		The reply consists of three bytes <i>u1</i> <i>u2</i> <i>u3</i>.
		If <i>u2</i>=<b>47</b> and <i>u3</i>=<b>13</b>, then conclude
		that we have a new Synaptics touchpad.</p>

		<p>Stage 7a: At this point we can narrow down to model type.
		If the thing is Synaptics or Alps, then Logitech is no longer interested.
		If it has 3 buttons, FirmwareID 1 and firmware revision <b>50</b>,
