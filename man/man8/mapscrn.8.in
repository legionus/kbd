The

console driver. The console driver may be later put into
.B use user-defined mapping table
mode by outputting a special escape sequence to the console device.
This sequence is
.I <esc>(K
for the

.I <esc>)K
for the

character set.
When the
.I -o
option is given, the old map is saved in
.I map.orig.

The
.I mapscrn
command can read the map in either of two formats:
.br
1. 256 byte binary data
.br

Format (1) is an image of translation 
.I table. 
Any time a character with the code
.I i
is output to the console device, the character with the code 
.I table[i]
appears on the screen. Format (2) is used to fill the 
.I table
as follows: cell with offset mentioned in the first column is filled
with the value mentioned in the second column.
