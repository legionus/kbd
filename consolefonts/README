Fragment of the "readme" file in Joel Hoffman's codepage.tar.Z
==============================================================

File readme.  June 14, 1992.

...
I have included two sample fonts, one written by myself and the other
by Dimitri Vulis (dlv@cunyvms1.BITNET).  Both are in the public
domain.  My font, 972.cp, is a Hebrew font.  The other is 880.cp, a
Cyrilic font (Russian etc.).

The Hebrew font uses the same encoding scheme as the VT-100's in
Israel, so any software that works on those will now run on Linux
(e.g., my hebrew.el package for GNU Emacs).

I'm told 880.cp follows the relevent Russian standard, so I suppose it
does.

This package, while (c) 1992 by Joel M. Hoffman, can be used as freely
as any other part of Linux.  

Files:
	972.cp		Font data for 25-line Hebrew font.
	880.cp		Font data for Cyrilic font.

===========================================================

Elsewhere I found fonts 880-14.psf, 880-16.psf, 972-14.psf, 972-16.psf,
but these turn out to come from 880.cp and 972.cp, and since setfont
now also understands *.cp files I deleted the four abovementioned fonts.

I developed the Latin-1 *.psf fonts; Pavel Zaboj did the Latin-2
ones.  SLS took them directly from Pavel's national package.
A DOS-hosted PSF font editor is available on eecs.nwu.edu.

Daniel Quinlan sent a new version of lat1-16.psf due to hpa and him.

Primoz Peterlin <peterlin@biofiz.mf.uni-lj.si> corrected lat2-??.psf.

===========================================================

The font default8x16 is from my hardware.
Bruno Haible contributed def2_8x16.

The fonts iso*.* are due to Kosta Kostis (kosta@blues.sub.de)
and were obtained from 
ftp.uni-erlangen.de:pub/doc/ISO/charset/isofont101.tar.gz

The fonts gr.* are due to Sarantos Kapidakis (sarantos@ics.forth.gr).
He writes: "I am sending you the greek fonts, for 8x14 and 8x16.
They follow the ELOT928 standard."

Paul Gortmaker (paul@rasty.anu.edu.au) contributed ugly_l
(which I removed again because now it can be found as 8x16alt
in his collection of fonts kbd_fonts.tar.gz obtainable from
sunsite.unc.edu:/pub/Linux/system/Keyboards/ and from
tsx-11.mit.edu:/pub/linux/sources/system/ ).

Some more fonts can be found in
sunsite.unc.edu:/pub/Linux/system/Keyboards/fontpack.tgz

Raul D. Miller (rockwell@nova.umd.edu) made aply16.psf.
Angelos Karageorgiou (angelos@netaxis.com) contributed gr*.psf.
Ahmed Naas (ahmed@oea.xs4all.nl) contributed 16[1-5].cp.
Daniel Yacob contributed the Ethiopic fonts (see README.Ethiopic).
Ricardas Cepas (rch@pub.osf.lt) contributed LatArCyrHeb-*.psf
and the lat4* fonts.
==============================================================

Since kbd-0.96, setfont will load compressed fonts.
When I tried gzip and bzip2, the former was superior:
uncompressed 543332 bytes, bzip2: 225285 bytes, gzip: 204039 bytes.
